    "# Key Takeaways\n",
    "1. In machine learning, we often need to load data in **mini-batches**, which are small subsets of the training dataset. How many samples to load per mini-batch is called the **batch size**.\n",
    "2. In addition to the Dataset class, we use a **DataLoader** class that takes care of mini-batch construction, data shuffling, and more.\n",
    "3. The dataloader is iterable and only loads those samples of the dataset that are needed for the current mini-batch. This can lead to bottlenecks later if you are unable to provide enough batches in time for your upcoming pipeline. This is especially true when loading from HDDs as the slow reading time can be a bottleneck in your complete pipeline later.\n",
    "4. The dataloader task can easily by distributed amongst multiple processes as well as pre-fetched. When we switch to PyTorch later we can directly use our dataset classes and replace our current Dataloader with theirs :)."
