class Solver(object):
    """
    A Solver encapsulates all the logic necessary for training classification
    or regression models.
    The Solver performs gradient descent using the given learning rate.

    The solver accepts both training and validataion data and labels so it can
    periodically check classification accuracy on both training and validation
    data to watch out for overfitting.

    To train a model, you will first construct a Solver instance, passing the
    model, dataset, learning_rate to the constructor.
    You will then call the train() method to run the optimization
    procedure and train the model.

    After the train() method returns, model.params will contain the parameters
    that performed best on the validation set over the course of training.
    In addition, the instance variable solver.loss_history will contain a list
    of all losses encountered during training and the instance variables
    solver.train_loss_history and solver.val_loss_history will be lists
    containing the losses of the model on the training and validation set at
    each epoch.
